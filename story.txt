The search engine system we designed caters specifically to three domains: Information Technology (IT), Health, and Astronomy. By utilizing various components from the provided code, this system will efficiently retrieve and analyze relevant information from these fields. The code provided includes essential components such as web crawling, indexing, searching, and text classification, which form the basis of our search engine.

To build the search engine system, we leveraged knowledge acquired from the course to enhance and optimize the system components. The web crawler was rebuilt from our previous assignment, but fine-tuned to ensure the collected data's quality and relevance to the respective domains. By utilizing the Soundex algorithm, our system was be able to handle spelling variations and phonetically similar words, leading to more accurate search results. Additionally, we incorporated machine learning techniques such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for topic prediction, which helped us categorize documents and enhance the relevance of our search results.
